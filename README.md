# Crypter-Bomb
It essentially will take in all the data in a file and make it unrecongnizable and destroy it, this should be compatable with windows, macos and linux this time.
USAGE: ./ran.py <target_directory> <target_file_extension>
Example:
./ran.py /home/user/projects/testenv/ .txt
This encrypts all files with the .txt in the "testenv" directory.
